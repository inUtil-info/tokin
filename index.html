   <h1 style="text-align: center;">This site demostrates an API walled garden by tokin</h1>
   <p>
   <a href="https://rapidapi.com/inutil-inutil-default/api/tokin/details">Tokin</a> is a cloud service designed by inUtil Labs to verify who is making use of an API. This is a free demo and is not intended for commercial purposes.
   </p>
   <p>
      To use this service, you will need to enter a valid token, which will be provided for free in the second step.
   </p>

   <p>
      The walled garden API shows the whatsapp profile picture fetched on real time, obtained from a public URL that is not protected by login credentials.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Is it legal using "whatsapp profile pic API"?
      
      This inUtil Labs API is simply a proxy to access Whatsapp assets of user generated content without tracking from Meta. Thus, all content is proxied from Whatsapp and is not stored on our servers, and, if Meta (or its users) chooses to remove an asset, it will no longer appear as a response of our API.
      
      Our API Gateway is hosted in the European Union, so the European Union's laws apply to it. Under the directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, "temporary acts of reproduction [...], which are transient or incidental [and] an integral and essential part of a technological process and whose sole purpose is to enable: a transmission in a network between third parties by an intermediary" is allowed, and legal.
      
      As such, any takedown requests must be sent to Meta, as we don't have any control on the data that they have on their servers.
